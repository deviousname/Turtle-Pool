# Turtle-Pool
Aperiodic Pool

todo:
- translate the ball positions when rotation key is press (buggy but works)
- add 8 ball and logic for it (8-ball exist, but needs its own logic class)
- better graphics (its progressing)
- music (none yet)
- main menu and settings pages improvement
- ai (none yet)
- online multiplayer (none yet)

Looking for people to help make this better by branching the code and improving it.
(I can't pay nothing, just want to see this grow.)
