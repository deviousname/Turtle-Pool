Aperiodic Pool

Controls:
- Left click on the cue ball and drag the mouse to aim, release or left-click to hit the cue ball.
- Right click to cancel shot.
- Middle mouse click table to move cue ball.
- 
- R will rotate the table
- (buggy - sometimes balls appear off table, just keep rotating)
- 
- Q and E will flip will either horizontally or vertically
- (doesn't move the balls to new position yet)

- ESC will open a menu that lets you click re-rack, change-player, or change instrument.
- Left and Right arrow keys will also change the instrument even without the menu open.

- To safely exit the game just press the X button on the window.


todo:
- translate the ball positions when rotation key is press (buggy but works)
- add 8 ball and logic for it (8-ball exist, but needs its own logic class)
- better graphics (its progressing)
- music (none yet)
- main menu and settings pages improvement
- ai (none yet)
- online multiplayer (none yet)

Looking for people to help make this better by branching the code and improving it.
(I can't pay nothing, just want to see this grow.)
